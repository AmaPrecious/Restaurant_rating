![](IMG_1549.JPG)

## Overview
A customer survey was carried out in this city in 2012 to collate information about each restaurant, their cuisines, information about their consumers and the preferences of the consumers.

## Problem statement
### Question 1.
What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?

### Question 2.
What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?

### Question 3.
Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?

### Question 4.
If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?


## Data Source
The analysis draws insights from five primary datasets: 'consumer_preferences.csv', 'consumers.csv', 'ratings.csv', 'restaurant_cuisines.csv', and 'restaurants.csv'. Additionally, the 'data-dictionary.csv' serves as a reference for understanding the variables and their definitions. These datasets collectively provide comprehensive information about both consumers and restaurants.

The 'consumers.csv' dataset contains detailed profiles of individual consumers, including demographic information such as age, marital status, and location. On the other hand, the 'consumer_preferences.csv' dataset delves into consumer preferences, offering insights into their preferred cuisines.

For restaurants, the 'restaurants.csv' dataset provides comprehensive information about each establishment, including location, services offered (such as parking availability and alcohol service), and customer ratings. The 'restaurant_cuisines.csv' dataset complements this by detailing the cuisines offered by each restaurant.

Furthermore, the 'ratings.csv' dataset presents an evaluation of various restaurant characteristics, reflecting consumers' experiences and satisfaction levels. This rich array of data allows for a thorough analysis of both consumer preferences and restaurant performance, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Data Analysis Process

The data analysis for this project involved the utilization of various tools and skills to extract meaningful insights. Here's an overview of the tools and skills employed:

1. *Excel:* Excel was used for data cleaning, manipulation, and basic analysis tasks such as filtering, sorting, and conditional formatting. It provided a familiar interface for initial data exploration and preparation.

2. *Power BI:* Power BI was utilized for more advanced data analysis and visualization. This powerful business analytics tool allowed for the creation of interactive dashboards, data modeling, and the generation of insightful visualizations.

3. *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):* DAX was employed within Power BI for creating calculated columns, measures, and complex calculations. It facilitated the manipulation and aggregation of data to derive key metrics and performance indicators.

4. *Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:* Skills in data cleaning and preprocessing were essential for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the dataset. Tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats were performed to prepare the data for analysis.

5. *Data Visualization:* Proficiency in data visualization techniques was crucial for presenting insights effectively. This involved selecting appropriate chart types, designing intuitive dashboards, and using visual elements to communicate findings clearly.

6. *Statistical Analysis:* Basic statistical analysis skills were applied to interpret numerical data and uncover patterns or trends. Descriptive statistics such as averages, frequencies, and percentages were calculated to summarize key aspects of the dataset.


Overall, a combination of technical skills in data manipulation and visualization, along with domain knowledge and critical thinking, were instrumental in conducting a comprehensive data analysis for the project.
